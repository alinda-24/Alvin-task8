# üéÆ Simple Game Application Development: Dynamic Player Movement and Interaction

Welcome to your next exciting programming challenge! In this task, you'll develop a simple game application that emphasizes dynamic player movement, a comprehensive scoring system, and engaging interaction with enemies. This task is designed to help you gain proficiency in using data from files to instantiate objects, designing classes effectively, and programming creatively. Let's dive in!

## üéØ Task Objectives

1. **Using Data from Files to Instantiate Objects**
   - Grasp file formats and parsing techniques.
   - Utilize file I/O classes for object attribute reading and conversion.
   - Manage exceptions and ensure data integrity.

2. **Designing Classes**
   - Identify class responsibilities and define interfaces.
   - Implement cohesive class structures.
   - Apply design patterns for common problems.

3. **Programming Creatively**
   - Explore problem-solving approaches and algorithms.
   - Encourage experimentation and iterating solutions.
   - Integrate user feedback for improving the application.

## üöÄ Exercises Overview

Your task consists of six exercises, starting with conceptual understanding and advancing toward a comprehensive game application. Each exercise will gradually increase in complexity and build upon prior concepts.

---

### üß† Exercise 1: Understanding File Data and Object Instantiation

**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with file formats and file I/O for object instantiation in Java.

1. **Question:** Describe the various file formats commonly used for data storage and retrieval. How do these formats influence the way data is read and objects are instantiated in Java?
   
2. **Explanation:** Explain how Java's file I/O classes such as `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, and `Scanner` can be leveraged to read data and convert it into object attributes.

---

### üìù Exercise 2: Principles of Class Design

**Objective:** Discuss the principles of designing well-structured classes.

1. **Question:** What are the key responsibilities a Java class should handle? How do these responsibilities influence the design of class interfaces?
   
2. **Explanation:** Describe how cohesion in class structures can be achieved and the role of design patterns in enhancing class designs. Provide examples of common design patterns applicable to this task.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Exercise 3: File Parsing and Object Creation

**Objective:** Implement code to parse data files and create game objects.

- **Task:** Write a method `public void loadGameObjects(String filename)` that reads game object data (like players, enemies, and items) from a file and instantiates the relevant objects.

```java
public void loadGameObjects(String filename) {
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            String[] data = line.split(";");
            // Example: PLAYER;Name;Score
            if (data[0].equals("PLAYER")) {
                // Instantiate a Player object
                String name = data[1];
                int score = Integer.parseInt(data[2]);
                // Create the Player instance here
            }
            // Handle other object types similarly
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

### üõ† Exercise 4: Designing Game Classes

**Objective:** Expand your coding skills by designing cohesive game-related classes.

- **Task:** Based on your understanding of class design principles, draft a UML diagram for the classes in your game, including `Player`, `Enemy`, and `GameWorld`. Briefly describe the purpose of each class and their interactions.

---

### üéØ Exercise 5: Implementing Player Movement and Scoring System

**Objective:** Implement the fundamental mechanics of the game, focusing on player movement and scoring.

**Instructions:**

1. **Player Movement:** Create a method `movePlayer(String direction)` in the `GameWorld` class to handle player movement through the game world. Ensure the player can interact with multiple objects and areas.

2. **Scoring System:** Develop a scoring system that updates the player's score based on various actions like collecting items or defeating enemies. Implement necessary getter and setter methods for score management.

---

### ü§ñ Exercise 6: Enemy Interaction and Game Completion

**Objective:** Round off your game by implementing enemy interactions and defining game win/lose conditions.

**Instructions:**

1. **Enemy Interactions:** Develop methods to handle interactions between the player and enemies. Decide upon a basic logic for enemy movements and attacks.

2. **Win/Lose Conditions:** Implement conditions for winning and losing the game. Use descriptive messages to inform the player of their status upon game completion.

# üìú Conclusion

By completing this task, you will enhance your Java programming skills through creative problem-solving, class design, and file-based object instantiation. Challenge yourself to ensure your game is engaging and enjoyable. Good luck and happy coding! üñ•Ô∏èüéâ
